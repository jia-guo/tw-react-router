# Base case

This base case project uses all the most common apis of react-router-dom (v5), including:

- BrowserRouter, Link, Switch, Route, Redirect
- component, render, and children props of Route
- withRouter
- hooks: useLocation, useHistory, useParams, useRouteMatch

The project is scaffolded with create-react-app. You can run `npm i` then `npm start` get it up and running. Just some very simple pages illustrating the basic usage of router apis.

We will write a teeny-weeny version of react-router-dom to realize the same functionalities.
